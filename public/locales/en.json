If you don't have them, you can add them later, but remember, you won't get results without photos.\n• The main photo is essential. It will be the cover of your ad, the only one sent by email to interested parties, and what will appear in the results list.\n• Arrange your photos logically to create an attractive story and opt for horizontal images that look great.\n• Including a hand-drawn floor plan, even if not detailed, provides useful information for interested parties to visualize the distribution of rooms and what it would be like to live there.",
